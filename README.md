# MedImage App

This app allows a medical doctor to take a photo with their iPhone or Android phone, and transfer the image
securely to their desktop system, which has the MedImage Server installed on it.

# Requirements

The project can be built with the PhoneGap Build tool.
The desktop system should have the MedImage Server at https://github.com/atomjump/medimageserv installed first.
